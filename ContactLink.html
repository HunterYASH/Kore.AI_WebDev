        <h1><pre>This is Example of Internal page linking
             and page should be opened in a new tab in a browser cause I have used target attribute
             and set it's value to _blank, that's why this page is opened in a new tab, otherwise
             by default any newpage is open on  the same page as previous one given we haven't
             used the target attribute inside our anchor tag..</pre> </h1>
